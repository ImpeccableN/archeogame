Digging out the profile box was just the beginning. We carefully peeled back the layers of soil, revealing bits of history. Then came the documentation. Measurements, photos, and sketches, it’s like leaving behind a perfect record for future archaeologists, just in case they
question our brilliance!

Once that was done, we moved on to piecing the artifacts together. Fitting them together was like a whole different pottery class game. Fragment by fragment, it slowly made sense.

By the end of the day, we had dug, documented, and puzzled together some amazing finds. Our team was in great form, and we’re ready for whatever comes next.

Here’s to more discoveries, more puzzles, and who knows, maybe Evans' lost hat is still waiting for us!"
