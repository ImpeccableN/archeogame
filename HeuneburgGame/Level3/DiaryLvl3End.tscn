Today was a real challenge, but one that ended in success! After days of carefully digging up pottery shards, I finally got to piece them back together. It felt a bit like when I was young, fixing a broken cup and hoping mum would not notice. except this time, she wouldn’t because of my tremendous work!

I laid out all the shards, hoping they’d magically fit together. Of course, they didn’t, so I got to work. Carefully matching each edge, piece by piece, it was slow at first, but with a bit of glue patience and sweat, everything started to come together.  


By the end of the day, I had successfully reassembled a vessel that had been buried for centuries. It’s a little rough around the edges, but after all that time underground, I’m calling it a big win. The satisfaction of seeing those fragments come together was well worth the effort.
