There, the block was analysed using the latest methods and the burial chamber was excavated.

A chariot grave with rich grave goods came to light, which contained jewellery made of gold and amber as well as this decorated bronze horse mask. The burial could be dated to the winter of 583/82 BC based on the good preservation of the wood."
