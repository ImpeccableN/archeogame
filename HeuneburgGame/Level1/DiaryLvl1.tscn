Today, we have two important tasks. First, we need to delegate roles to our team to ensure a smooth excavation. With clear assignments, we can work efficiently and uncover more secrets from the Heuneburg site.

Next, we'll create a planum, the first step in our dig. This involves carefully removing the top layers of soil to reveal signs of ancient human activity. We start by peeling back the topsoil and continue removing layers until the first features appear. Archaeologists will guide the excavator to remove more soil or level the area, marking features while the soil is still fresh, as the sun can dry it quickly.

These steps help us document the excavation area. Soil discolorations reveal past human activities and sometimes artifacts, mainly pottery. Discolorations occur when different materials fill holes, pits, or trenches, telling the site's history. Common causes include human activities like waste pits and postholes, and natural events like tree falls and animal burrows.

By completing these tasks, you'll play a crucial role in uncovering the stories of the past. Let's get started and make some exciting discoveries today!
